  <span *ngIf="num % 2 === 0"> {{ num }}</span>

  <!-- let's say if we have css written for all the spans then that will apply on above span too -->
  <!-- to avoid this scenario we can use ng-container ,given that we do not add any html element inside ng-container
    then no layouts, styles anything will affect it because angular does not create dom for it i.e we will just have the data without any html element housing it-->

<!-- ng-template can be rendered only with structural directives  -->

<!-- Pay attention to [ngIf] here this is because angular transforms *ngIf to [ngIf] internally to render structural directive compo -->
<!-- also we use ng-template when we want to have an else block -->

<div *ngIf="false; else elseBlock">If condition is true show this block</div>
